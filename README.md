  <h1>Game Agent For Mortal Kombat </h1>

  <h2>Project Overview</h2>
  <p>This project,  was part of our final year project where we implemented advanced AI techniques to create an intelligent agent capable of 
    competing in the popular fighting game, Mortal Kombat. By utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Deep Q-Networks (DQN), our agent learned to adapt and
    perform in a dynamic gaming environment.</p>

    <h3>Supervised Training</h3>
    <p>Involves training an AI agent using supervised learning techniques, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Multinomial Logistic Regression. The agent is trained within the retro environment of the game <strong>Mortal Kombat Version 2</strong>.</p>  
    <h4>Overview</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Supervised Learning:</strong> The agent is trained using labeled data from Mortal Kombat game play.</li>
        <li><strong>CNN Training:</strong> Convolutional Neural Networks are utilized to recognize and predict in-game actions based on the visual inputs from the game.</li>
        <li><strong>Multinomial Logistic Regression:</strong> Used as part of the supervised learning process to classify actions based on the input features.</li>
        <li><strong>Retro Environment:</strong> The AI agent is developed and tested in the retro environment of Mortal Kombat Version 2, enhancing its ability to interact within the game.</li>
    </ul>

<h3>Reinforcement Learning Training</h3>
<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>Agent can learn and interact with a game environment autonomously. The AI uses reinforcement learning principles,
  with a custom class handling the memory, actions, and learning process. The environment interaction is done using 
  screenshots and automated inputs.</p>

<h4>Files in this Repository</h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Train.ipynb:</strong> The main Jupyter Notebook where the AI model is developed and trained. 
      It includes the following sections:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Imports and Setup:</strong> Importing necessary libraries like TensorFlow, Keras, PIL, and automation tools such as PyAutoGUI and PyDirectInput.</li>
            <li><strong>Custom AI Class (mk):</strong> A custom class that defines the AI agent, including its memory, learning rate (gamma), exploration rate (epsilon), and other key attributes for reinforcement learning.</li>
            <li><strong>Agent Initialization:</strong> Instantiating the AI agent with the <code>mk</code> class.</li>
            <li><strong>Gameplay Interaction:</strong> The agent interacts with the game using the <code>play()</code> method, which includes taking screenshots and performing actions based on the learned policy.</li>
            <li><strong>Game State Capture:</strong> Capturing screenshots of the game using PyAutoGUI and cropping the images to focus on relevant areas for the agent to process.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>Results</h4>
<p>The AI agent is trained to interact with the game environment, making decisions based on the game state captured through screenshots. The results include the agent's ability to perform certain tasks or improve its performance over time as it learns.</p>
